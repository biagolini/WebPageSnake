# Snake Game

A simple implementation of the classic Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is designed to provide a lightweight and easy-to-understand version of the game, suitable for testing infrastructure services, learning purposes, or as a starting point for further development.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone or download the repository to your local machine. Once downloaded, open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to start playing the game.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, and Right) on your keyboard to control the snake. The goal is to eat the red fruit while avoiding collisions with the snake's own body. The snake will grow in length as it eats more fruit. The game will continue until the snake collides with its own body.
